### [Python 3 Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html) - https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
#python3/python/programming

Very helpful reference for magic things that you can do on your beginners journey using python, like


`[x*y  for  x  in  range(10)  for  y  in  range(x,  x+10)]`.
```
def f(a, b):
...     print(a, b)
...
>>> f(b=1, *(2,))
2 1
```
BTW, If you ask - what is difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`? 
The str function is supposed to return a user friendly format, which is good for logging or to display some information about the object. And the __repr__ function is supposed to return an “official” string representation of the object, which can be used to construct the object again.
```
>>> import datetime
>>> now = datetime.datetime.now()
>>> now.__str__()
'2023-01-21 16:28:00.324317'
>>> now.__repr__()
'datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 21, 16, 28, 0, 324317)'
```
